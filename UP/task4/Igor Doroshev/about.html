				<a class="text">Sasha Grey (born Marina Ann Hantzis; March 14, 1988) is an American actress, model, author, musician, and former pornographic actress. She first made her name in mainstream media after appearing on several popular television programs and in pop culture magazines, examining her willingness to enter the world of hardcore porn at a young age. She has also been featured in movies, television shows, music videos and advertising campaigns. She won numerous awards for her work in pornography between 2007 and 2010, including the Female Performer of the Year at the 2008 AVN Awards.</a>
				<p class="miniheader">BACKGROUND</p>
				<a class="text">Grey was born and raised in North Highlands, California, to a working-class family. Her mother worked for the state of California, while her father was a mechanic. Her father was a Greek-American, while her mother is of English, Irish and Polish descent. Her parents divorced when she was five years old, and she was subsequently raised by her mother, who remarried in 2000. Her father died in June 2015.<br><br>Grey attended four high schools, among them Highlands High in California, having been unhappy in each one, though she graduated a year early at the age of 17. In late 2005, she attended Sacramento City College and took classes in film, dance, and acting. She waited tables at a steakhouse through March 2006 and saved $7,000 for a move to Los Angeles.<br><br>Grey states that her parents were not happy with her involvement in the adult industry, but that they are on good terms nonetheless.</a>
