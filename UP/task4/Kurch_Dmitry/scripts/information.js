    "cake": "Shortened Cake",\
    "description": "Shortened cakes include cakes made with all kinds of fats, including butter,\
     lard, vegetable shortening, and more. But this category is often referred to as *butter cakes* \
     as a catch-all term because of butter*s proliferance in baking recipes.\
     They are considered *shortened* because the high amount of butter or fat actually \
     shortens the gluten strands that form when flour comes in contact with water. \
     The shorter gluten strands result in a more tender texture, which creates a delicate, soft crumb."\

    "cake": "Pound Cake",\
    "description": "Pound cake is just about the butteriest of butter cakes out there. \
    The name *pound cake* comes from the French *quatre quarts*, which refers to the equal amount \
    of the key ingredients (flour, butter, sugar and eggs) in the cake.\
    Compared to other butter cakes, the ratio of butter or fat is much higher, which gives \
    the resulting cake a dense texture, tight crumb and sturdy shape. Pound cakes work extremely \
    well for cake decorating projects, as they will hold their shape even when sculpted, and they \
    won*t collapse under the weight of fondant or buttercream. "\

    "cake": "Foam and Sponge Cakes",\
    "description": "Nestled under this category are cakes such as angel food cake, genoise, dacquoise or jelly\
     roll-style cakes. Eggs are the name of the game with fluffy foam or sponge cakes.\
     Usually, air is beaten into the eggs (sometimes just the whites, sometimes the whole egg),\
     and then they are folded into the batter. During the baking process, this creates steam in \
     the batter, causing the cakes to rise."\

    "cake": "Egg Whites Only",\
    "description": "Cakes made with egg whites only are light, airy and naturally low in fat.\
    Perhaps the most famous example of this type of cake is angel food cake.\
    The whipped egg whites assist in attaining a spectacular rise, so specific pans are required\
    for cakes made solely with egg whites. Think of the famous angel food cake pan, with its\
    high sides and circular cutout in the center, which allows for even baking and rising. "\

    "cake": "Flourless Chocolate Cake",\
    "description": "A great example is flourless chocolate cake, in which whipped egg whites are folded\
    into a rich mixture of chocolate, egg yolk and butter or cream, and egg yolk. While the method is similar\
    to a sponge cake, its ingredient list makes it decidedly different from a roulade or sponge cake.\
    Chocolate cakes contain a very small amount of flour\
    (from a few tablespoons to 1/4 cup or so), but would still fall under this category. "\

    "cake": "Unbacked Cakes",\
    "description": "Unbaked cakes are confections that require no baking at all. \
    This category would include desserts such as no-bake cheesecake, ice cream cakes and icebox cakes.\
    It*s more the construction and presentation than the ingredients which classify these desserts as *cakes.* "\

    "cake": "Yeast Cakes",\
    "description": "While most people think of yeast as a bread ingredient, it*s also employed in many cakes.\
    Cakes made with yeast tend to have a much sturdier texture and a more mild sweetness. With a less tender\
    crumb, they aren*t likely to be used for birthday or wedding cakes, but instead for more hearty cakes\
    such as coffee cakes or the famous New Orleans specialty, King Cake."\
